// there is a finite amount of native events you can
// "listen" for, events like "click" or "scroll"

// here we define the element we will be adding a
// listener to.
const element = document.body
// `body` pretty much means anywhere in our app!

// here we are defining the method we want to call
// whenever that event we care about happens
const onClick = () => {
  console.log('you clicked me!')
}
// as usual, you can name it anything,
// but descriptive names are great!

// finally, we are specifying that whenever
// a "click" happens on the body
// we want the above method above to run.
element.addEventListener('click', onClick)
