// There are two versions of a Component's setState

// The simpler one, just takes an object that
// is a subset / partial of its State

type State = {
  playerOneWins: number
  playerTwoWins: number
}

this.setState({ playerOneWins: 1 })

// React will overwrite only that specific property,
// keeping any others as they were,
// That is why we will not lose playerTwoScore!
